Please join us on Wednesday, December 1, at 11 a.m. PT (12 p.m. MT, 1 p.m. CT,
2 p.m. ET) for a discussion with Meredith Farkas about <i>Building a Better Collective Future with Slow Librarianship</i>, the perfect antidote when achievement, productivity, and external validation have left you hollow and yearning for more reflection, collaboration, and inclusion (see attached flyer).  Slow librarianship offers a path to a radical new future with more meaningful values-driven work and relationships, and thankfully Meredith has the map.
