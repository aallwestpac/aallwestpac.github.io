Dear WestPac members,

In honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, our colleague Victoria Szymczak from the [University of Hawaii School of Law](https://www.law.hawaii.edu/) will be speaking to WestPac members on May 26 from 12pm-1pm PST.  Her presentation will look at the origins of Pacific Island legal systems, the legacies of colonialism in the Pacific region, and will celebrate the unique legal frameworks found in the Pacific region that help protect indigenous cultures in the face of Western creep.  As we explore the origins of these new countries' legal systems, we will watch a documentary on the historical practice of blackbirding and how this practice affects displaced Pacific Islanders today.  This sinister slice of history is not well known and serves to demonstrate the obstacles under which Pacific Islanders have struggled in their reach for independence.  Key constitutional provisions will be reviewed as we bring our discussion forward to the 21st century.

We thank Vicki for offering this program to our members which is brought to you by WestPac's newly formed Diversity & Inclusion Committee.

If you are interested in attending, please reach out to [Tawnya Plumb](mailto:tplumb@uwyo.edu) for the Zoom link.
