On behalf of the WestPac Grants Committee, I'm pleased to announce that the WestPac Executive Board has approved funding for 3 grants to attend the 2015 WestPac Annual Meeting in Honolulu.

I realize no one is all that enthusiastic about going to Hawaii (Beaches? Blech.), but the conference programs look quite interesting, so please consider applying. The first grant is an unrestricted award for $1000\. The second is the DJ Morrison Grant, which was established to provide financial assistance to WestPac members pursuing careers or having job responsibilities in the area of electronic services to attend the Annual Meeting. This year, the DJ Morrison Grant is $1000\. The third grant is a free conference registration. For this grant, no letters of recommendation are required. You just need to complete the application form by the deadline.

The application deadline for all three grants is August 24th, 2015.
