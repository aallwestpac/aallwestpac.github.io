## Teach-In Kit Pandemic Edition: Resources for Virtual Education

Calling all emergency online teachers!

In the quick transition from in-person to online teaching, did you develop materials for your classes that you feel worked particularly well? Did you design processes or draft procedures for moving content online that streamlined things for you or your students? Did you assist the faculty at your institution in moving their materials online, or provide content for them to use in their classes? We want to hear from you!

The RIPS/SIS Teach-In Kit Committee is putting together a Teach-In Kit: Pandemic Edition; a resource for all of us to utilize in advance of (what is sure to be) a transitional spring semester with both online and in-person content shaping legal education. We would love to hear from you, to hear about what works and what doesn't in "these times," and for all of us to learn from each other so we can move from emergency teaching to solid online instruction and be leaders in our institutions.

We're on the hunt for the following materials: 

* Instructions/processes for putting things online; 

* Tips and tricks for online teaching; and

* Asynchronous materials and supplemental materials prepared for other professors' courses.

Submissions are due on **November 16th**!  If you're willing to share,[ please submit your contributions here](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.gle%2F6E5TBBTnrbScwjVt8&data=04%7C01%7Ccabanissjaso%40seattleu.edu%7Ce41478978cd9445cf8da08d875174e52%7Cbc10e052b01c48499967ee7ec74fc9d8%7C0%7C0%7C637388090240514381%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=qbqpzQVP2dfJOQWasCLH%2BIOJfB3WNvOr4resq5gBcvk%3D&reserved=0). 

Stay tuned for a full Teach-In Kit (and request for submissions) in Spring of 2021!
