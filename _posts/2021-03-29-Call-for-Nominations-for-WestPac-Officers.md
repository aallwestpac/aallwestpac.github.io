The WestPac Nominations and Elections Committee is seeking nominations for the positions of Vice-President/President-elect and of Treasurer. Don't be shy about nominating yourself. If your library has a rigid institutional structure with not a lot of room for upward movement, executive roles in professional organizations are an excellent way to fill leadership gaps on a résumé.

Here are the position descriptions:

President

· Lead the business meetings

· Get Board approval for Local Arrangements Committee proposals

· Update committee memberships

· Organize the business meeting lunch at AALL

· Communicate with AALL on behalf of the chapter

VP/Pres-elect

· Line up all the educational programming for the Annual Meeting. VPs differ in terms of how much assistance they've asked for/received from the Education Committee in organizing the programming.

Secretary

· Take notes at business meetings

· Receive any proposed amendments to the WestPac Constitution

· Prepare the official ballot for elections & run the elections

· Keep track of membership records: send written notice of dues to members, let the Membership Committee know about new WestPac members, send the names of new members to the Newsletter editor, inform the WestPac webmaster of new members

Treasurer

· Manage bank account

· Track membership

· Track income and expenses

· Tax return 

To nominate yourself or a colleague, please email Annalee Hickman,

WestPac Nominations and Elections Committee Chair, at [HickmanA@law.byu.edu](mailto:HickmanA@law.byu.edu) by Tuesday, April 6, 2021.
