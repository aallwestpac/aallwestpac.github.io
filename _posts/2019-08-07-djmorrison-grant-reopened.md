The deadline for travel grant applications for the WestPac annual meeting in Spokane passed last week, but the committee received no applications for the DJ Morrison travel grant, which provides financial assistance to an electronic services librarian who would like to attend the annual meeting. This year's DJ Morrison grant is for $500. 

The committee would like to honor the spirit in which the grant was created so we are **re-opening the application period for the DJ Morrison grant until August 14** and we encourage electronic services librarians (or those who have responsibilities that include electronic services) to apply. We did receive applications for the WestPac travel grant, so we will not be accepting additional applications for that grant.

 

More information and grant applications are available on the WestPac website: [http://chapters.aallnet.org/westpac/grants.asp](http://chapters.aallnet.org/westpac/grants.asp). Please [contact me](mailto:Stacey.Gordon@mso.umt.edu) with any questions.
