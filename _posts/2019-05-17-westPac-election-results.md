The 2019 election has come to a completion and we have our results:

 

The winners are David and Lee, both winning 62-0. Congrats to both new officers! 

 

A hearty mahalo to Jill Sturgeon for running the election as well as the Nominations and Election committee (Kerry Lohmeier (Chair), Barbara Swatt Engstrom, Anna Blaine, and Annalee Hickman).
