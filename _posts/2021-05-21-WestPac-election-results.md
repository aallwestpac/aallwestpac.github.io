Dear WestPac members,

Congratulations to our incoming Vice-President/President-Elect **Anna Blaine**, and re-elected Treasurer **Lee Van Duzer**!  Each received 100% of the votes cast for their respective offices.  The election results can be found <a href="files/WestPac Election Report_2021.pdf">here</a>.

Thank you to Secretary Sharalyn Williams and the Nominations and Elections Committee (Annalee Hickman and Youngwoo Ban) for all of their work on this year's election.  

And, thank you to all who voted!
