We look forward to seeing everyone on Wednesday, October 13, at 12 p.m. PT (1 p.m. MT, 2 p.m. CT, 3 p.m. ET) for the start of WestPac's Fall 2021 Education Series (see attached flyer).

First up is presenter Chris Long from the University of Colorado’s Norlin Library.  Chris will provide an update about what has happened in the intervening years since a group of Dartmouth College librarians and students tried to change the Library of Congress Subject Heading “Illegal aliens” (as documented in the film, Change the Subject).  Chris will also describe how his library has implemented alternate subject headings to replace “Illegal aliens” in the library’s catalog.

Viewing the Change the Subject documentary in advance is recommended, but not essential. You can view the documentary <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/83024/d4hq3s42r">here</a>.

Let's get to know Chris a little.  Chris Long is Director of the Resource Description Services Team at the University of Colorado Boulder University Libraries. He was co-chair of ALA’s Subject Analysis Committee (SAC) from 2018-19. Prior to his arrival in Colorado, he served as Catalog Librarian for 21 years at the Ruth Lilly Law Library, at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, and in 2010 was chair of TS-SIS.
