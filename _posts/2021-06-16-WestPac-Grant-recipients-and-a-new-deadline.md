On behalf of the Grants Committee, I'm delighted to announce that Anna Russell has been awarded the  AALL Registration Grant and Julie Horst has been awarded a WestPac grant to cover the cost of registering for the AALL Virtual Conference. We have more money to give away, however, so we are extending the deadline to apply for the four remaining registration grants. If you wish to apply for an AALL registration grant funded by WestPac, please complete the application and email it to Hilary Hardcastle (hardcast@uchastings.edu) by Friday, July 2. The grant application can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gNIrgu0yp-un8bBk6-DUqlvF7alSD7iK/view?usp=sharing) (You may need to open in a new tab to access the file). Remember, you donâ€™t need to be an AALL member to apply for one of the WestPac grants.
