WestPac just learned that we are eligible for AALL's complimentary conference registration this year. The grant is intended to go to a newer member of AALL who is also a member of WestPac. Unfortunately, the deadline to notify AALL of our chosen recipients is June 15. As a result, we are seeking grant applications on an accelerated schedule. If you wish to apply for the AALL grant or **one of five AALL registration grants** funded by WestPac, please complete the attached application and email it to me by Sunday, June 13. The good news is you don’t have to submit any letters of recommendation! And you don’t need to be an AALL member to apply for one of the WestPac grants. The grant application can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gNIrgu0yp-un8bBk6-DUqlvF7alSD7iK/view?usp=sharing) (You may need to open in a new tab to access the file).

On behalf of the Grants Committee, I urge you to apply!  As a reminder, the AALL conference is virtual again this year. The dates are July 19-23.
