**The WestPac Membership Committee invites nominations for life membership.**

Our chapter bylaws provide that to qualify for life membership, the nominee must:

1) have been an active member of the chapter for ten or more years;

2) have reached the age of 55 years or older; and

3) have retired from active law library work.

A benefit of life membership is the waiver of annual dues. Additional information may be found on our[ website](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchapters.aallnet.org%2Fwestpac%2Flifemembers.asp&data=04%7C01%7Ccabanissjaso%40seattleu.edu%7C0346f1b363894c1e632408d9454f233c%7Cbc10e052b01c48499967ee7ec74fc9d8%7C0%7C0%7C637617028468527069%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=bWR8P2eEsM1riu4jSvz4fin1XuJUzbwXDGRAqujxToo%3D&reserved=0).

We hope to profile nominees in the summer newsletter and vote at the annual business meeting this fall.
