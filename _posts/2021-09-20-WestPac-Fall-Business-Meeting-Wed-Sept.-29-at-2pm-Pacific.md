Dear WestPac members,

Please mark your calendars for WestPac's Fall Business Meeting that will be held via Zoom on **Wednesday, September 29, at 2pm Pacific time**.  We need at least 20 members to attend so that we have a quorum to vote on Life Member nominees (Jaye Barlous, Stacey Gordon Sterling, and Harriet Zook), install new officers, and hear updates from WestPac committees.

If you are a committee chair, please start preparing your reports for the meeting.  Please send those to me before the meeting or let me know if you plan to give a verbal report during the Zoom meeting.

It promises to be a very brief meeting — 30 minutes maximum — so please make every effort to attend, especially to show your support for our Life Member nominees.

I will send Zoom log-in details on the WestPac listserv a few days before the meeting.

We look forward to seeing everyone on the 29th!

Thank you,

David McClure

WestPac President
