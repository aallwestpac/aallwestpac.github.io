Hello WestPac! Our annual meeting is next week in Spokane, WA, and I'm looking forward to seeing many of you.

 

Our programming finishes at noon on Saturday, leaving plenty of time to head over to Green Bluff Farms Fall Harvest Festival. If anyone's interested in checking out the corn maze, listening to some music and enjoying tasty fall treats, email me and we’ll set up some carpooling. More information about the festival is below.

 

Hope you'll join me,

Kerry
