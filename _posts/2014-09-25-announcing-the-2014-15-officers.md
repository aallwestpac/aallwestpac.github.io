title: Announcing the 2014/15 Officers
---

Mari Cheney from Boley Law Library at Lewis and Clark Law School will be the 2014/15 Vice President/President Elect. Mari assumes the office of Vice President at the conclusion of the fall annual meeting in Seattle as Bonnie Geldmacher takes the reins as President.

Tawnya Plumb, from the University of Wyoming College of Law Library, was appointed Interim Secretary last Spring to fill an unexpected vacancy, and has been officially elected to fill the office of Secretary for the next 2 years.

Thanks to Tami Gierloff (Chair) and the Nominations and Elections Committee, for their efforts. And a big thank-you to Mari and Tawnya for helping to keep WestPac vital and effective.
