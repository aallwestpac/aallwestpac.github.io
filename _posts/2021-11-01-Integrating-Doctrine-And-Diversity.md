Please join us on Wednesday, November 10, at 9 a.m. PT (10 a.m. MT, 11 a.m. CT, 12 p.m. ET), for a fascinating discussion with editors and contributors Nicole P. Dyszlewski, Raquel J. Gabriel, Suzanne Harrington-Steppen, Anna Russell, and Genevieve B. Tung about the collection of essays [Integrating Doctrine and Diversity: Inclusion and Equity in the Law School Classroom](https://cap-press.com/books/isbn/9781531017019/Integrating-Doctrine-and-Diversity) (see also attachment).  The race, economic status, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or physical or mental abilities of the litigants in case books often go unexamined, so it is incredibly important that a collection such as this offers reflections, practical advice, and specific instruction on how to integrate DEI issues into the first-year doctrinal courses so faculty and librarians can equip law students with the empathy and awareness they need to fight prejudice and inequality and the current laws that perpetuate both.

You can read the book's Table of Contents, Foreword, and Introduction, and the first three essays, including those by editors Nicole P. Dyszlewski and Genevieve B. Tung, on Amazon for free via the <a href="https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B0945VNXZT&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_39E8C98357PT356E82XS&reshareId=VK3EMH9470CCSY1994Q9&reshareChannel=system" target="_blank">Look Inside</a> feature.
