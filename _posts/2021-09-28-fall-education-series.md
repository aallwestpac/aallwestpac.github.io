## Fall Education Series

Happy first day of autumn.  In celebration of layered clothing and crisp air, please mark your calendars for WestPac's virtual Fall 2021 Education Series (see flyer below).  

The scheduled lineup includes the following:

    - Chris Long's update on the Library of Congress' efforts to change the subject heading "Illegal aliens"
    - the Integrating Doctrine and Diversity authors' discussion about their book and the tools, methods, and exercises that create a more diverse, inclusive, and ultimately richer classroom experience
    - and finally, Meredith Farkas' reminder that achievement culture is a false idol and a sorry substitute for balance, inclusion, teamwork, and authenticity

Registration details, Zoom information, and presenter biographies for each program are forthcoming.
