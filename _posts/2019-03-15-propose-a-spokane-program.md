It’s time to start putting together the program for WestPac’s Annual Meeting in Spokane, Washington this October 10-13. More information, including options to reserve your room at the Historic Davenport Hotel, are available on the [WestPac website](http://chapters.aallnet.org/westpac/thisyear/index.asp)

The WestPac Education Committee is looking for program proposals and ideas.  Do you have expertise you’re willing to share? Is there something you’d like to learn or someone you’d like to hear from?  Please send me your ideas and proposals by April 15th.

Thanks!
