title: WestPac Events at AALL
---

Via Mari Cheney: WestPac is just over a week away. Don't miss our events at the annual meeting.

WestPac Chapter (AALL):

1) WestPac is hosting this year's Pacific Chapters Joint Reception! Join your fellow WestPac-ers as well as LLOPS, NOCALL, SCALL and SANDALL members at Chicago's famous Portillo's restaurant, located at 100 W. Ontario (at the intersection of Ontario & Clark), on Saturday, July 16, from 7:00-9:00 p.m. Thanks to a generous donation from Thomson Reuters, in addition to a full buffet meal, drinks are on us!

2)  Plan to attend the WestPac Business Meeting and lunch on Sunday, July 17, at 12:30 in the Hyatt-Plaza Ballroom A. Lunch is only $10. If you haven't registered for the lunch yet, please send your RSVP and $10 payment to Jaye Barlous. (The registration form is attached.)

3) Finally, if you haven't yet taken the survey regarding the likelihood of your attendance at the WestPac annual meeting in Jackson Hole, please take a minute to do so. It would help us in finalizing arrangements in order to keep our costs as low as possible.  Of course you are not bound in any way by your responses.
