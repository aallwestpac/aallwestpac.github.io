Hello WestPac members!

Since we will not be meeting in-person for this year's annual chapter meeting, we will be holding our fall business meeting on **Saturday, September 26, at 3 PM (Pacific Time)**.  It will be hosted online via Zoom (log-in details will be sent to everyone closer to the date).  The meeting will be immediately followed by a social / happy hour to give us a chance to connect and catch up.  (We chose to meet on a Saturday so members in all WestPac time zones could enjoy and participate!)

In addition to officer and committee reports, we will also be announcing details at the fall business meeting about two roundtable discussions that will take place on **October 6** and **November 12** to provide our members with additional educational and social opportunities in the coming months.

So, please mark your calendars for Saturday, September 26, at 3 PM (Pacific Time) for the fall business meeting.  We look forward to "seeing" you then!

On behalf of the WestPac Board,

Kerry

 

PS. I'd like to give a big thank you to special committee co-chairs David McClure and Mari Cheney, and committee members Kathy Carlson, Karen Seldon, Bonnie Geldmacher, and Brian Huffman, for planning and making this all happen. Iâ€™m so grateful for their work.
