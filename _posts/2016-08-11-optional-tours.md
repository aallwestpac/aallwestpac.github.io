Many WestPac members know that optional tours are an important part of our annual meeting.  We hear and share stories about haunted mines, fishing boat expeditions, and glass gardens.  The Local Arrangements Committee hopes the tours offered this fall in Jackson Hole will not disappoint.

- **Optional Tour 1**:  [Jackson Hole Winery](http://jacksonholewinery.com/)  
 Please join us for a 2 hour tour and tasting session at Jackson Hole Winery beginning at 6:30pm on Friday, September 30th.  The cost is $28 per person and includes light appetizers.  Participants will  be responsible for transportation to and from the venue, which is about 5 miles (a short cab ride) from Snow King Resort.

- **Optional Tour 2**:  [BrushBuck Grand Teton Dusk Bus Tour](http://www.brushbucktours.com/grand-teton-tours/grand-teton-dawn-or-dusk-four-hour-tour/)  
Interested in wildlife viewing in the Tetons with an optional hike?  If so, sign up for this 4 hour sunset tour beginning at 3pm following the conference on Saturday, October. 1st.  The cost for the bus tour is $99 per person and includes resort pick-up, gratuity, refreshments, binoculars, and spotting scopes for each guest.  Each participant will be required to pay an additional park entry fee of $20 which is good for seven days and is transferable to Yellowstone National Park.
