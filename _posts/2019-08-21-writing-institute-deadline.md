### **First Annual WestPac Writing Institute**

We are pleased to announce that the first annual WestPac Writing Institute will be held on Oct. 10, 2019, at Gonzaga University School of Law immediately prior to the WestPac Annual Meeting. 

Our institute is inspired by the Boulder Conference and is a place for attendees to present works-in-progress on any topic related to legal information. The Writing Institute will begin at 12:30 on Thursday, Oct. 10, and conclude in time for the WestPac Annual Meeting opening reception the same evening. There is no registration fee but WestPac membership is required. Not a member? [Join today!](http://chapters.aallnet.org/westpac/membership.asp)

The Writing Institute is limited to 8 attendees. Each person attending will be expected to submit a draft work-in-progress in advance of the conference; attendees will be chosen from among those submitting their work. All attendees must also read the other accepted papers to facilitate discussion at the institute.

The work should focus on some aspect of law librarianship or legal information, including:

* __the use or teaching of legal information,__
* __information retrieval,__
* __law and policy,__
* __information access issues,__
* __practice issues.__

To apply for the Writing Institute, submit a draft for consideration no later than **Aug. 26 at 5 p.m.** The draft must be more than an outline but need not be in publishable form (between 4-8 pages). Please submit your draft via e-mail to Mari Cheney at [maricheney@lclark.edu](mailto:maricheney@lclark.edu). Those chosen as Writing Institute participants agree to submit a working draft of at least 4,000 and no more than 15,000 words for review by September 23. All drafts will be circulated to everyone attending to allow ample time for reading and thought.

Please contact me directly with any questions. Special thanks to Susan Nevlow Mart for inspiring regional writing conferences to promote scholarship in our profession.
