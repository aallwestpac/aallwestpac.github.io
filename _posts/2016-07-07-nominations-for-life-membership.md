title: Nominations for Life Membership
---

The WestPac Membership Committee invites nominations for life membership. Our chapter bylaws provide that to qualify for life membership, the nominee must
1. have been an active member of the chapter for ten or more years;
2. have reached the age of 55 years or older; and
3. have retired from active law library work.

A benefit of life membership is the waiver of annual dues. Additional information and a list of current life members may be found at [http://www.aallnet.org/chapter/westpac/lifemembers.asp](http://www.aallnet.org/chapter/westpac/lifemembers.asp).

We encourage you to think of colleagues who have retired in the last few years and consider nominating them for life membership. Please send nominations by Monday, July 25, to Stephanie Midkiff, Chair, WestPac Membership Committee: westpac.membership@gmail.com. And if you know of any updates or corrections to this list, please let us know via the same email account.

Any remarks in support of the nomination would be greatly appreciated. We hope to profile nominees in the summer newsletter and vote at the business meeting during our annual conference in Jackson Hole.ï»¿
