Due to the timing of our initial call for papers, we didn't receive the participation we anticipated so we are opening up the First Annual Writing Institute to anyone in WestPac who intends to write a professional article and is at various stages of writing (or brainstorming). 

* Do you have an idea for a paper but need help fleshing it out?

* Have you presented at a professional conference and want to turn the presentation into a paper?

* Do you have a draft for an article but don't know where to publish it? 

* Do you have a draft of an article you'd like to get feedback on?

If you're thinking about writing, want to know more about the process, or would like feedback on a draft, please plan to attend. The Writing Institute is free and will take place on Thursday, Oct. 10, prior to the WestPac opening reception at Gonzaga University School of Law. 

Please respond to [Mari Cheney](mailto:maricheney@lclark.edu) by **September 9** to let us know you're interested and what phase of the writing and/or brainstorming process you're at.
