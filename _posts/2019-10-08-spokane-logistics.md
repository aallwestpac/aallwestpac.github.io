Hello WestPac!

It's about 48 hours until we kick off our annual meeting in Spokane. 

If you're coming in by plane, you have a couple of options for traveling the 8 miles in from the airport:
 

* The Davenport Hotel provides transportation for $25, but you must contact them in advance to arrange pick-up. Call 509.789.7385.

* Uber or Lyft might cost about $18 to $25 depending on traffic.

* Spokane Public Transit runs a bus (I think it's the #60) every half hour and it takes about 30 minutes to get to the hotel area. Cost is $2.

* There are traditional taxis, too, but I haven't researched pricing.

Additional information about ground transportation is available at [https://spokaneairports.net/ground-transportation/](https://spokaneairports.net/ground-transportation/)

Once you're at the Davenport, the amenity fee (which is waived for WestPac participants), includes bike rentals and free transportation in the downtown area.

For transportation to the opening reception at Gonzaga University, you can walk the lovely Centennial Trail to get to campus (about 30 minutes), or an Uber or Lyft should be under $10. Use the address 721 N. Cincinnati Street, Spokane, WA 99220-3528 to get to the Chastek Library to check in for the meeting and take a tour before a short walk over to the Museum for the reception.  

So looking forward to seeing everyoneâ€”please let me know if you have any questions!

#### UPDATE

*From [Sharalyn Williams](mailto:williamss2@gonzaga.edu ) at Gonzaga:

I will have temporary parking passes available at the desk for those needing them. This will allow them to park on campus in any of the green lots for up to a week if they would like.

For all of the vehicles needing these, I will just need:

Vehicle State & License Plate Number\\
Make\\
Model\\
Color of vehicle\\
Phone number
