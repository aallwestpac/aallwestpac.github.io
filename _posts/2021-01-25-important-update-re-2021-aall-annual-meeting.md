##Important Update re: 2021 AALL Annual Meeting

Dear WestPac members,

With apologies for duplication, I wanted to highlight today's announcement that the AALL Annual Meeting will be held virtually this year.  If you received the announcement directly from AALL, please note that there is a very brief, three-question survey linked in that email.  I would encourage you to complete the survey to assist AALL in its planning for the virtual conference.

WestPac typically holds a Chapter meeting at the AALL conference when the schedule permits.  We do not yet know how scheduling of Chapter meetings will be handled for this year's virtual AALL conference, but we will be sure to provide an update once we have more information.

Thank you all, and take care,

David McClure

WestPac President
