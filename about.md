**WestPac** is the Western Pacific Chapter of the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL); serving libraries and law librarians in Alaska, Hawai'i, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, as well as British Columbia (Canada).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This "blog" is the source for the announcements on the [WestPac website](http://chapters.aallnet.org/westpac/), the chapter's home page.

Feedback should be directed to the [webmaster](mailto:aallwestpac@gmail.com). Fair warning: that email account doesn't get used very often, so it isn't checked every day, or even every week. However, the message will get through, eventually.

#### If you're interested in the backend development:

Announcements on this site are contributed by librarian volunteers who don't necessarily code, so we are using the [Gabriel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gabriel/okimajjeocnndpifeelaajdebkkbckff?hl=en-GB) add-on for Google Docs to make the process easier. Announcements submitted via an authorized Gabriel instance are automatically posted without any moderation.

This repo was created with [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), then modified by adding those parts of [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) used for the sidebar. Thanks to everyone who contributed directly or indirectly to either of those projects.

The sidebar animation was inspired by [Jelena Jovanovic](https://codepen.io/plavookac/full/qomrMw).
